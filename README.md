#AngularJS + RequireJS + Asp.Net MVC Sample

Example of project using AngularJS with AMD + RequireJS + Asp.net MVC.

A lot of credits go to the library [AngularAMD](https://github.com/marcoslin/angularAMD).

Some other librarys in this example include
* JQuery - No need to explain I think;
* Underscore - "Linq" library for javascript;
* Select2 - A very powerfull replacement for the "select" element;
* Bootstrap Calendar - A full screen calendar based in bootstrap calendar. Actually I can live without this one, but it's there anyway, take a look;
* Spin - Loading animation with javascript.

More explanations about why I created this repo and some basic explanation about the code [here](http://blog.diegopires.com.br/2014/04/21/large-apps-with-angularjs/).
